  I am a recent Masters graduate in Applied Social Data Science at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). I am actively looking for opportunities in data driven roles.
  <br><br>
  As an intern at Deloitte Consulting (Digital), I discovered my interests in consulting and data analytics. I find the process of project-based problem solving intellectually stimulating. I have a good command of data analysis tools such as Python, R, and SQL. As well as data visualisation tools such as Tableau, Ggplot2, and Matplotlib.
